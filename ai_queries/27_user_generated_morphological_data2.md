You are helping me with a project to generate thoroughly annotated online texts in Ancient Greek for readers. The project repository is up-to-date at: &lt;https://github.com/Eumaeus/Dramaturg.jl/tree/main&gt;.

In the directory `ai_queries` are enumerated files of the queries that got us to the present state of the project. The output from the current code can be found in the directories `data` and `morph/output`, and for html editions, `editions` (which also includes template files.)

The directory `scripts` contains the scripts that constitute the current pipeline. This pipeline is described in `docs/Pipeline.md`. There are concise "recipes" specific to my three demonstration texts. The current output in `data/` is the result of me walking through each of these recipes.

The scripts of the pipeline depend on Julia code in the `src` directory.

Everything is driven from `scripts/config.toml`.

## A Tool for User-Generating Morphology

This is a follow-up to my request, documented at `ai_queries/26_user_generated_morphological_data1.md`, which you helped me with earlier. Your new code works beautifully! 

I would like to create a web-app called "MorphologyDocumenter", to allow users to generate, systematically, cleanly, and with some validation built in, records for morphological forms.

This would be a stand-alone webapp, which would live in the `webapps` directory. I think I have all the pieces necessary.

I wrote a Javascript version of BetaReader, which is on GitHub here: https://github.com/Eumaeus/BetaReader.js

I wrote a "POS-Generator", a menu-driven application for creating POS-tags: https://github.com/Eumaeus/pos-tagger. I wrote it in ScalaJS, so its compiled JS code is not human-readable. Its functionality should not be at all hard to implement in standard Javascript.

Because I also intend to use this for teaching, having students create data and submit it, the web-page should have an "Editor's Name" field, with some default value like "editor".

I imagine four fields on a webpage for Greek words: unicode-surface-form, betacode-surface-form, unicode-lemma, betacode-lemma. Let's let the users just type in Betacode (if they can't use betacode, they have no business presuming to add to a Greek morphologial dictionary).

So they type a beta-code surface-form, and the unicode-surface-form field is automatically populated, keystroke by keystroke. Likewise, they type a lemma in betacode.

**We actually want to generate two kinds of records here!**

We want something like:

`ἀποπαρδήσομαι	a)popardh/somai	πέρδομαι	pe/rdomai	urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n81011	v1sfim---`

Which will roll into the morphological dictionary build process.

We also want something like:

`urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0019.tlg009.fu.sp:10.1.text.token.6	ἀποπαρδήσομαι	a)popardh/somai	πέρδομαι	pe/rdomai	urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n81011	v1sfim---`

Which can roll into the editorial index for the current text.

So there will be two fields in this webapp for URNs. One for the text-token-CTS-urn, and one for the LSJ-urn. 

I have edited the Dramaturg reader-html-pages to show the text-token-urn for a selected token and allow users to click on it to copy the URN it to the clipboard.

I have added that functionality to the LSJ webapp, so users can click on an LSJ entry's urn and copy it to the clipboard.

The text-token-urn field can have a default dummy value—`urn:cts:greekLit:group.work:token`—since I can imagine classroom uses where there is not a specific text associated with the generated morphology.

There should be a menu-driven POS-generator, where the user can specify the parsing of the new form.

And a "Download Form" button that will download two files: "For_user_generated_morphology-[EDITOR-NAME]-[DATE].tsv" and "For_editor_index-[EDITOR-NAME]-[DATE].tsv".

With this, the user can generated data that will go into the pipeline, documenting this new form *and* associating it with a specific textual context.

I would include a copy of `source-data/dictionaries/lsj_urns.txt`, so the app can confirm that the LSJ-URN is at least a valid URN, present in the lexicon data.

I think the very best version of this app would allow a user to generate a list of entries, one after another, and download the list of generated entries in the two formats. when they click.

Not only would this be useful for enhancing these Dramaturg online texts, but I can think of a dozen ways to have my students use something like this as they study Greek.

It will be useful for the end-user HTML reading environment, but should also be useful for other purposes as well.

This is a follow-up to a query you helped me with. This is where we were:

https://github.com/Eumaeus/Dramaturg.jl/blob/main/ai_queries/27_user_generated_morphological_data2.md

I have created a GitHub repository for our work on this project here:

https://github.com/Eumaeus/MorphologyDocumenter/tree/main

It looks great! A few refinements…

It seems only to download the "For_editor_index-X-2026-06-09.tsv" file. Maybe Javascript has a limitation of one-file per download? Maybe we need two buttons?

It would be ideal to allow a user to click on an entry in the list and edit it again.

The Beta-code parsing should check for a sigma at the end and make it a terminal-sigma.

Let's give the user some help generating POS-tags.

A default value (= "no value") should be "-", not "x", which I think means "other".

Let's disable irrelevant menus until they become relevent. In my old POS-Generator, it went like this:

- All menus are disabled except "Part of Speech".
- A user changing a menu will enable or disable others according to what is possible and appropriate.
- If the user selects "Noun", "Pronoun", or "Article", then the menus for "Case", "Gender", and "Number" are enabled.
- If the user selects "Adjective", then "Case", "Gender", "Number", and "Degree" are enabled.
- User selects "Verb", then "Mood" is enabled.
	- User then selects "Indicative", "Subjunctive", "Imperative", or "Optative", and "Voice", "Tense", "Person", and "Number" are enabled.
	- User selects "Infinitive", and only "Voice" and "Tense" are enabled.
	- User selects "Participle", and enables: "Voice", "Tense", "Person", "Case", "Number".
- User selects "Adverb" and the only other menu enabled is "Degree".
- "Preposition" enables no other menus.
- "Preposition", "Conjunction", "Interjection", "Punctuation", and "Irregular" enable no other menus.

This is looking terrific.

The popup menus are not populating the POS-tag, except for the "POS" menu. And in the data-list, we want the Perseus POS-tag in the "POS" position. It is confusing, with "Part of Speech" being used in two senses. Let's use POSTag to refer to the 9-character code `v1sfim---`, and "part of speech" for the part of speech ("noun", "verb", etc.).

The page is exactly as I hoped it would look!

I've checked in the latest changes. I did a little work on the beta-code interpretation of diacritical marks.

https://github.com/Eumaeus/MorphologyDocumenter

The app is still not downloading two files. What would be ideal are two downloaded `.tsv` files containing the data from the list of user-documented morphological forms.

The "Editor's Name" property should not appear in the data, only in the file-name.

The first file should be called `For_morphological_dictionary_[name]_[date].tsv`. It should have this format:

`uc-form	bc-form	uc-lemma	bc-lemma	lsj-urn	pos-tag`
`ἀποπαρδήσομαι	a)popardh/somai	πέρδομαι	pe/rdomai	urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n81011	v1sfim---`
`…`

The second file should be called `For_editors_index_[name]_[date].tsv`. It should be like the previous format, but with a text-token-urn:

`token-urn	uc-form	bc-form	uc-lemma	bc-lemma	lsj-urn	pos-tag`
`urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0019.tlg009.fu.sp:10.1.text.token.6	ἀποπαρδήσομαι	a)popardh/somai	πέρδομαι	pe/rdomai	urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n81011	v1sfim---`
`…`

But we are so close to a perfect app!
